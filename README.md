# ChracterRecognition_v1

To Do:
-Add training data
-Add testig data
-Work for all letters, not just 10 of them (a, d, m, n, o, p, q, r, u, w)
-Fix accuracy

Working:
-Image processing works well
-Binarization works well
-Outlines training characters in red pretty well and labels appropriately

How it works:
-Takes in training images where the character is known
-Works for (a, d, m, n, o, p, q, r, u, w)
